# Tank Royale
#### Please note, Tank Royal is in Pre-Alpha stages of development. The current game does not reflect the end result. Currently development is getting a working game with simple controls and simple mechanics. In the future, the game will consist of; More advanced controls, such as the player will have to individually control each track of the tank. More advanced mechanics, such as aiming mechanics and shooting mechanics, Projectiles will be effected by gravity pull and maybe even wind!
Simply a low poly tank battle royale! Open-world, head-to-head tank battle with advanced controls using Unreal Engine 4.

## Want to help development?
### Donating money
Donations will help fund the project. I am not a 3d model artist and therefor will need to purchase or have models made. Sound effects, music and graphic design will also need to be paid for, donations will help this ALOT! In the future, I may even focus on adding members to the Blurr Development team.
A link where you can donate will be provided [HERE](), once the game is in a playable state. I do not want to except donations until the game is playable.

### Other ways of helping
Of course you can donate assets to help production of Tank Royale. I will add a structure for accepting assets in the near future when they're needed.
